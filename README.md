# Python-Simulation
Simulating Real-World Processes With Python (A movie theater as a case study)

# Running the Script
The file ```main.py``` contains the code base taking up OOP from the ```movie_theater.py``` file. You can execute the code by running ```python3 main.py``` from the directory that contains the file.

Here are some sample output:
1.
```
Input the number of working cashiers: 4
Input the number of working servers: 3
Input the number of working ushers: 1
Running simulation... 

The average wait time is 29 minutes and 2 seconds.
```
2.
```
Input the number of working cashiers: 2
Input the number of working servers: 3
Input the number of working ushers: 2
Running simulation... 

The average wait time is 37 minutes and 4 seconds.
```
3.
```
Input the number of working cashiers: 3
Input the number of working servers: 1
Input the number of working ushers: 2
Running simulation... 

The average wait time is 34 minutes and 40 seconds.
```

# In conclusion
This shows there's a huge effect on the average wait time for everyone going into the movie theater with respect to the number of cashier and server available. The number of available usher doesn't take much effect on the people.
